# itunes_missing_artwork
This uses the [iTunesLibrary framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ituneslibrary) to learn what media do not have artwork. It then uses the [MusicKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MusicKit/) to search for the artwork on Apple's Catalog.

In Catalina, the Music.app has lost 100s of the artwork it used to have for years. The application itself cannot find this artwork. However using the API provided by Apple, much of the artwork can be found.
